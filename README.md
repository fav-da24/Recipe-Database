# Recipe Database
This simple `recipe_database` consists of two tables, `recipe_ingredients` and `recipe_instructions`.

## Creating Tables
### Table 1: `recipe_ingredients`
This table will store the ingredients, measurements, and any additional notes.

### Table 2: `recipe_instructions`
This table will store the steps involved in the recipe.
